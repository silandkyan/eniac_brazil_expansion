*Data analysis for a Spanish online marketplace company aiming to enter the Brazilian market.*
Created by Philip Groß, January 2024

## Eniac
Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded 2008 in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries. In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers.

## Expansion plans
Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies.

Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. In addition, Magist provides after-sales services such as stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to the shipment.

## Task: Explore if Magist is a viable local partner
The economic conditions of the deal are already being discussed. But not everyone in the company is happy moving on with this. There are two main concerns:

- Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
- Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The goal is to explore the database and find out if Magist is a viable partner for entering the Brazilian market.
